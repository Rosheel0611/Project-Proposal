# Project-Proposal!
A robotic pet in P5js!

The final product will be an interactive virtual pet displayed on the canvas using p5.js. The pet will have stats like hunger, energy, and happiness that change over time. The user will interact with it using on-screen buttons (or keys) to feed, play, or rest the pet. If the user neglects it, the pet will become sad, tired, or even “shut down.”

Visuals and animations will change depending on the pet’s current status (e.g., happy face, sad face, sleepy eyes).


I will practice abstraction by designing and implementing a custom class (RoboPet) with attributes and methods.

Improve my ability to write clean, useful functions with parameters and return values.

Strengthen my understanding of class design, state management, and simulation logic.

Learn how to debug and iterate on code over time and document progress through GitHub commits.

Experience building a program that grows in complexity and evolves through feedback and testing.
